## Security

Always sanitize user-provided content before passing it to `MDXContent`. This includes sanitizing `value`, `components`, and `dependencies`.

Failing to do so puts you at risk of a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. See the [MDX security documentation](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started#security) for more information.
