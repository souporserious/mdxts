Collections are a way to organize and query file-system data in Renoun. They are a powerful tool that allows you to define a schema for file exports and query those exports using a simple API.

## Creating a Collection

Let's look at an example of how to create a collection for a blog. We'll define a collection that queries all `mdx` files in a `posts` directory:

```tsx filename="collections.ts"
import { collection, type FileSystemSource } from 'renoun/collections'
import type { MDXContent } from 'renoun/mdx'

type PostsSchema = {
  default: MDXContent
  frontmatter: {
    title: string
    description: string
  }
}

export type PostsSource = FileSystemSource<PostsSchema>

export const PostsCollection = collection<PostsSchema>({
  filePattern: 'posts/*.mdx',
  baseDirectory: 'posts',
  basePath: 'posts',
})
```

In this example, we define a `PostsCollection` that will query all `mdx` files in the `posts` directory. The `PostsSchema` defines the shape of the file exports, and the `PostsSource` is the type of the source that will be queried.

We can now query the `PostsCollection` in our application. For example, using a framework like Next.js, we can create a page that lists all the posts in the `posts` directory:

```tsx allowErrors filename="app/posts/page.tsx"
import { PostsCollection } from '../../../collections'

export default async function Page() {
  const sources = await PostsCollection.getSources()

  return (
    <>
      <h1>All Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {sources.map((source) => (
          <li key={source.getPath()}>
            <a href={source.getPath()}>{source.getPath()}</a>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  )
}
```

To render the content of a post, we can use the `source` object:

```tsx allowErrors filename="app/posts/[slug].tsx"
import { PostsCollection } from '../../../collections'
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'

export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const source = await PostsCollection.getSource(params.slug)

  if (!source) notFound()

  const frontmatter = await source.getExport('frontmatter').getValue()
  const Content = await source.getExport('default').getValue()

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
      <p>{frontmatter.description}</p>
      <Content />
    </>
  )
}
```

## Composite Collections

In addition to creating individual collections, Renoun also allows you to define **composite collections**. A composite collection is a combination of multiple collections, allowing you to treat them as a single entity. This can be useful when you want to query across different directories or file patterns while maintaining a unified interface.

### Creating a Composite Collection

Let's say you have two collections, one for blog posts, and another for components. Using a composite collection, you can combine these into a single collection that can be queried as if it were one:

```tsx
import { collection } from 'renoun/collections'

const PostsCollection = collection({
  filePattern: 'posts/*.mdx',
  baseDirectory: 'posts',
})

const ComponentsCollection = collection({
  filePattern: 'src/components/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  baseDirectory: 'components',
})

const AllCollections = collection(PostsCollection, ComponentsCollection)
```

With this setup, `AllCollections` allows you to query across both `PostsCollection` and `ComponentsCollection` seamlessly.

### Querying Across Collections

When retrieving a source and querying for siblings, composite collections will account for all sources across the collections it comprises:

```tsx allowErrors
const source = AllCollections.getSource(
  'posts/how-to-build-a-button-component'
)!

const [previousSource, nextSource] = await source.getSiblings()
```

Here, `source.getSiblings()` will return the sources from both `PostsCollection` and `ComponentsCollection` as a combined set.

### Narrowing Source Types

Collections provide a type guard to check if a source belongs to a specific collection within a composite collection. You can use the `<Collection>.hasSource` method to safely narrow the type of a source when working with composite collections:

```tsx allowErrors
if (ComponentsCollection.hasSource(nextSource)) {
  // nextSource is now typed as a ComponentsCollection source
}
```

This type guard ensures that youâ€™re working with the correct source type within a composite collection, allowing you to access schema-specific exports.

## Conclusion

Collections can be used to generate static pages, create navigations, site maps and much more. At their core, they abstract files and directories into either a `CollectionSource`, `FileSystemSource`, or `ExportSource` allowing you to analyze and render them programmatically.
