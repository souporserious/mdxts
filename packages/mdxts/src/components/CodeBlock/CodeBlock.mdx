<Note>
  This component is automatically set up to override the `pre` element when
  using the [Next.js plugin](/packages/next).
</Note>

Use the `source` prop to render a code block from a source file.

For example, the following MDX:

```mdx
<CodeBlock source="./counter/useCounter.ts" />
```

Will produce a code block with the contents of `./counter/useCounter.ts`:

<CodeBlock source="./counter/useCounter.ts" />
