# References

Each symbol can list all of its references. This is useful for finding all of the places where a symbol is used. If a specific symbol is not provided, all references will be listed for the current MDX file.

```mdx
import { References } from 'mdxts'

<References />
```

For rendering specific references, you can pass a symbol:

```mdx
import { References } from 'mdxts'
import { Button } from './Button'

<References symbol={Button} />
```
