# Type Checking

All code blocks are type checked using the TypeScript compiler based on the `tsconfig.json` file local to the project that MDXTS is running in. This helps to identify and prevent errors in your code blocks.

## Suppressing Errors

If you want to suppress errors for a specific code block, you can add an `allowErrors` flag to the code block:

````mdx
```tsx allowErrors
const a: string = 1
```
````

This will prevent the code block from erroring when being type checked.

<Note>
  You can codemod existing code blocks to add this flag by running `mdxts
  --codemod noTypeCheck`.
</Note>

### Allowing specific errors

To only allow specific errors, you can add the `allowErrors` flag with a comma separated list of error codes to allow:

````mdx
```tsx allowErrors=2588
const a: string = 1
```
````

This is useful for educational purposes, when you want to show the error message to the user.

<Note>The error code can be found in the error message.</Note>
