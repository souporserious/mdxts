# Getting Started

<Summary>
  MDXTS compiles and type checks your MDX and TypeScript files for building rich
  interactive, and type safe content. Built on [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/),
  [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), and [TS Morph](https://ts-morph.com/).
</Summary>

## Install

The `mdxts` library can be installed using your favorite package manager:

```bash
npm install mdxts
pnpm install mdxts
yarn add mdxts
```

Once installed, you can set up the Next.js plugin that will build a graph of your content and code blocks throughout your project:

```next.config.mjs
import { createMDXTSPlugin } from 'mdxts/next'

const withMDXTS = createMDXTSPlugin({
  theme: 'theme.json',
  gitSource: 'https://github.com/souporserious/mdxts/tree/main',
})

export default withMDXTS({
  ...
})
```
