# Getting Started

<Summary>
  MDXTS compiles and type checks your MDX and TypeScript files for building rich
  interactive, and type safe content. Built on [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/),
  [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), and [TS Morph](https://ts-morph.com/).
</Summary>

## Install

The `mdxts` library can be installed using your favorite package manager:

```bash
npm install mdxts
pnpm install mdxts
yarn add mdxts
```

Once installed, you can use the cli to build your content:

```bash
mdxts build
```

This will produce a `dist` directory that will contain a `mdxts.json` file of all the files that were built. This file can be used to generate a knowledge graph of your content.

## Configure

By default, MDXTS will look for a `mdxts.config.js` file in the current working directory. This file is used to configure the build process.

```mdxts.config.js
export default {
  output: 'dist',
  tsconfig: 'tsconfig.json',
}
```
