# Types

Lists the types for the closest exported modules in `index` if used in a `README` file, otherwise it will throw an error if no `index` file is found or is not used in a `README` file.

```mdx
import { Props } from 'mdxts'

<Types />
```

For rendering specific types, you can pass a symbol:

```mdx
import { Props } from 'mdxts'
import { Button } from './Button'

<Types symbol={Button} />
```
